for the site server use flask if needed to use differente librairies for the project to make it diversified
create data base with sql (or start with json to see how it works with fastapi)
finish html css js site
electron app in html css js

libraises to use -> :
Database ORM    / SQLAlchemy    works with FastAPI
Data visualization    / Chart.js / Plotly.js(for 3D)   Easy to embed into HTML via <canvas>, Chart.js for simple and responsive dashboards or Plotly.js for advanced interactivity
App communication      / REST / or WebSocket(live visualization without polling*)    Electron app can fetch JSON
Local database     / SQLite (local dev/testing) -> PostgreSQL (production/main server)

at the end put server around web -> :
Home Server    Expose pc via router and dynamic DNS -> orange settings: 192.168.1.1     setup needed -> see there:

use a linux like ubuntu, rocky linux or debian ?
HTTPS -> handled by NGINX or CADDY + Let’s Encrypt
FREENOM -> take a free domain name or create one
DOCKER (+ docker compose) -> assign ports and the reverse proxy container
CORS -> limit allow_origins to domain and app
Authentication -> API Key or JWT for Electron app
deployment -> host 0.0.0.0, run via systemd/Docker, reverse proxy with NGINX or CADDDY
+ (if we wanted, if ip dynamic dns don t work) Ngrok for development / demo (fast, no router setup) or permanent home server access: Use DuckDNS + port forwarding + Nginx/Caddy for HTTPS.

* = Polling is a method where a client (like a browser or Electron app) repeatedly asks the server for updates at regular intervals.
